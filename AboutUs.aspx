<h1>About Us</h1>

<p1>We are the INDEXER. A beatiful collaboration of the 4 smartest men alive. Scientists predicted that the coming together of 
    such incredible minds could cause global combustion and spell the end of the human race. However these incredible minds somehow managed
     yield together and lock into a sublime harmony who's intellectual output would change software history forever. Learn more about these warriors here... </p1>

   <b>Lyuben</b><br><br> Brilliantly Blunt. A coding guru that says it how it is. Arugably the most dynamic coder in the history of computing. 
    His fingers grace the keys as soft as a concert pianist and when required as fast as a jazz maverick. Lyuben poured his blood and sweat 
    into this hack day and without him this revoloutianary piece of software would still be floating around space. We are eternally
    grateful of his contribution to this dream team. int a=1; b=7; MIND BLOWING!

     <b>Jeff</b><br><br>
     
      Rumour has it he created Fife in a day. A man of value, a man of principal but most of all a man of musical instrument impersinations.
    Jeff has recited many an imaginery instrument over his career and has even performed the imaginary jazz trumpet in front of the Queen at 
    the Royal Variety Show back in 1986. However inspiring his gift is for playing Imaginary instruments, it is but only the tip of his Titanic sinking iceberg of talent. 
    The master of pipes and the servant for all users of the world wide web. Jeff was put on this planet to think outside the box. In fact Jeff thinks so far out the box
    that he no longer has any idea whatsoever where the box is. This however does not phase jeff as he is currently in deep thought about how to find the box again, which his thinking thought him 
    so far away from. Perhaps the thinking of finding the box again could lead him further still from the box. Jeff is currently thinking about this possibility but at the same time trying not to as thinking 
    about it may be leading him further away from the box. Someone needs to write an algorithm for this whole box thinking problem.<br /> </div>
